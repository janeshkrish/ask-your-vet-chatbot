If there is bleeding, apply gentle pressure with a clean cloth.\n\nThird, **try to assess the situation**. Is the bone obviously protruding? Is your dog in extreme pain? Knowing these details will help me advise you better.\n\nHowever, **the best course of action right now is to bring your dog in for an examination as soon as possible.** A broken leg requires proper diagnosis (usually with x-rays) and treatment. We need to stabilize the leg and manage the pain.\n\n**Please tell me:**\n\n*   **Where are you located?** I need to know this to advise you on the best way to get your dog to the clinic and whether I need to prepare anything for your arrival.\n*   **How did the injury happen?** This information can help me understand the potential severity and other possible injuries.\n*   **Are there any other concerning symptoms, such as difficulty breathing or loss of consciousness?**\n\n**Do not attempt to splint the leg yourself unless absolutely necessary and you have prior experience.** Improper splinting can cause further damage.\n\nLet's get your dog the help he needs.
